#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is a systematic approach to developing high-quality software using engineering principles, methods, and tools, enabling the creation of reliable, scalable, and innovative solutions that meet user needs.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The history of software engineering traces back to the 1940s and 1950s with the emergence of the first digital computers.
Milestones include the development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C), the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s, the advent of structured programming in the 1970s, and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Phases:

1. Requirements: Gather and document user needs and system requirements.
2. Design: Create high-level and detailed software architecture and user interface designs.
3. Implementation: Write code and build software according to design specifications.
4. Testing: Conduct tests to ensure software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5. Deployment: Release software to users or customers.
6. Maintenance: Provide ongoing support, updates, and enhancements after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall and Agile methodologies:

Waterfall:

1. Linear, sequential approach
2. Suitable for projects with:
    - Well-defined requirements
    - Fixed timelines and budgets
    - Low risk of change
    - Regulatory or compliance requirements
EXAMPLE: Developing a simple website: requirements are well-defined, and changes are unlikely

Agile:

1. Iterative, incremental approach
2. Suitable for projects with:
   -Uncertain or changing requirements
   - Need for rapid delivery and iteration
   - High risk of change
   -  Emphasis on collaboration and customer involvement
EXAMPLE: Developing a mobile app: Changing requirements, rapid delivery and iteration are necessary 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).

Version Control Systems (VCS): Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Challenges in Software Engineering:

- Changing Requirements: Scope creep and delays
- Tight Deadlines: Rushed development and compromised quality
- Technical Debt: Impeded future development and increased maintenance costs

Strategies to Overcome:

- Effective Communication
- Agile Methodologies
- Prioritization of Tasks
- Regular Reassessment of project goals and timelines

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Software Testing Types:

1. Unit Testing: Tests individual code components.
2. Integration Testing: Tests how components interact.
3. System Testing: Tests the entire software system.
4. Acceptance Testing: Tests from a user's perspective.

Importance:

- Identifies defects early
- Ensures quality and reliability
- Validates software meets requirements and user expectations

These testing types ensure comprehensive software quality assurance.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt Engineering: Designing and optimizing text prompts to interact with AI models, ensuring accurate and relevant outputs.

Importance:

- Clarifies intent
- Improves accuracy
- Enhances user experience
- Increases efficiency
- Unlocks AI potential

Effective prompt engineering enables users to communicate effectively with AI models, achieving better results and insights.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about AI"

Improved Prompt:
"Explain the key benefits and applications of artificial intelligence in healthcare, within the last 5 years, in 150 words or less."

Why Improved:
It is specific, with clear scope, concise output and well-defined task.
